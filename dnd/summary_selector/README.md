# Summary Selector
Each week at DnD, we must decide who will write the summary for the next week. This software will make that easier.

We need to be able to specify a list of people who attend in a given week and select one person from the list at random to write the summary.
After that person is selected, they should not get selected again until everyone else has been chosen.
The script should not need to always be running (i.e. each week I want to call the script once, have it spit out a name, and remember who it has chosen previously).
Being able to specify the names through a YAML file would be useful and coding it in Ruby would be preferable.
